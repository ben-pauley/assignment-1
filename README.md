## My Repository

In my GitHub repository, you will find my completed assignment for week 2 of the programme. My task was to refactor the code for the Horiseon website so that it follows accessibility standards and is opitimised for search engines, which I believe I have met the criteria for. I did this by using semantic HTML elements, ensuring the code followed a logical structure, consolidating CSS selectors and properties and making the whole code base accessible and easy to follow.

## Installation

Nothing is required to install my project, but the project is deployed live at this URL https://ben-pauley.github.io/assignment-1/.

## Software used

This project was completed using Visual Studio Code and I tested the website using Google Chrome.
